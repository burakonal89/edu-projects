\chapter{AIRFLOW PHASE ESTIMATION}
\label{chp:airflow_phase_estimation}
We will present more than one methods to estimate the respiratory phases in this chapter. In one approach we will use the estimated airflow and in the other approach we will not use that, we directly use neural networks. In both methods we will use the estimation of breathing period.
