abstract="Current breathing flow estimation methods use tracheal breath sounds, but one step of the process, `breath phase (inspiration/expiration) detection', is done by either assuming alternating breath phases or using a second acoustic channel of lung sounds. The alternating assumption is unreliable for long recordings, non-breathing events, such as apnea, swallow or cough change the alternating nature of the phases. Using lung sounds intensity requires the addition of a secondary channel and the associated labor. Hence, an automatic and accurate method for breath-phase detection using only tracheal sounds would be of great benefit. We present a method using several breath sound parameters to differentiate between the two respiratory phases. The proposed method is novel and independent of flow level; it requires only one prior- and one post-breath sound segment to identify the phase. The proposed method was tested on data from 93 healthy individuals, without any history of pulmonary diseases breathing at 4 different flow levels. The most prominent features were from the duration, volume and shape of the sound envelope. This method has shown an accuracy of 95.6{\%} with 95.5{\%} sensitivity and 95.6{\%} specificity for breath-phase identification without assuming breath-phase-alteration and/or using any other information.",

abstract="A simple, non-invasive acoustical method is developed to detect respiratory phases in relationship to swallows without the direct measurement of airflow. In 21 healthy subjects (4--51 years) breath sounds are recorded at the trachea and at five different recording locations at the chest wall, with simultaneous recording of airflow by a pneumotachograph. The chest signal with the grestest inspiratoryexpiratory power difference (`best location') is either in the mid-clavicular line in the second interspace on the left or third interspace on the right. Using the `best developed and achieves 100{\%} accuracy in the estimation of respiratory phases without using the measured airflow signal. Thus, acoustically monitoring breaths and swallows holds promise as a non-invasive and reliable assessment tool in the study of swallowing dysfunction.",
